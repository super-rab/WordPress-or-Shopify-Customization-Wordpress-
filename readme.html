You can override a plugin layout by copying the plugin’s template file into your theme (or child theme) and matching the same folder and filename structure.
WordPress will automatically load your theme’s version instead of the plugin’s when rendering that layout.
This approach uses the template hierarchy, allowing safe customization without modifying the plugin’s core files.
